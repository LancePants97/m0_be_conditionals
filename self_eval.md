# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? It is useful to use a conditional statement in your code when you are trying to determine if something is true or false. It is also used to set "rules". For instance, you would use a conditional to run/ a part of your code based on if something is true or false or if certain values are equal to each other.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently? If I was to do this assignment again differently, I would experiment with different way of laying out the code to get to the same answers. There is usually more than one way to write something, and I want to familiarize myself with all the different options so that I can determine which would be the most efficient way to solve future coding problems.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? Writing a code that WORKS was the most satisfaction I got out of this. Initially, I kept only putting one equals sign instead of 2 in the "medium.rb" assignment and I could not figure out why my code wasn't compiling properly. Going through my notes and finding my silly mistake and correcting it was extremely satisfying and made me feel like I am actually catching on and getting familiar with this whole new process of writing code.
